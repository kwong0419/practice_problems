# You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

# Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

# For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
# Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

# A leaf node is a node with no children.

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 25
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
# The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
# Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

# Example 2:


# Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
# Output: 1026
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
# Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# The depth of the tree will not exceed 10.

def sumNumbers(root):
    def dfs(node, current_sum):
        if not node:
            return 0
        
        current_sum = current_sum * 10 + node.val
        
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return current_sum
        
        return dfs(node.left, current_sum) + dfs(node.right, current_sum)
    
    return dfs(root, 0)

# Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the tree
# Space Complexity: O(h) - where h is the height of the tree (in the worst case, the tree is skewed and h can be n)

# Example Usage:
print(sumNumbers([1,2,3])) # 25
print(sumNumbers([4,9,0,5,1])) # 1026
