# Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

# Return the sum of the three integers.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

# Constraints:

# 3 <= nums.length <= 500
# -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

def threeSumClosest(nums, target):
    nums.sort()
    closest = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if abs(total - target) < abs(closest - target):
                closest = total
            if total < target:
                left += 1
            elif total > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return target
    return closest

# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Example Usage:
print(threeSumClosest([-1,2,1,-4], 1)) # Output: 2
print(threeSumClosest([0,0,0], 1)) # Output: 0
