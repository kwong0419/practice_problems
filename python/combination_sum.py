# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

# The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

# The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
# Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
# Explanation:
# 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
# 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
# These are the only two combinations.

# Example 2:

# Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
# Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

# Example 3:

# Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
# 2 <= candidates[i] <= 40
# All elements of candidates are distinct.
# 1 <= target <= 40

def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, target, path):
        if target == 0:
            result.append(path)
            return
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            if candidates[i] > target:
                break
            backtrack(i, target - candidates[i], path + [candidates[i]])

    candidates.sort()
    result = []
    backtrack(0, target, [])
    return result

# Time complexity: exponential in the worst case, roughly O(N * (T/minC)^d) where N = candidates.length, T = target, minC = min(candidates).
# Space complexity: O(T / min(candidates)) recursion depth plus output storage.

# Example usage:
print(combinationSum([2,3,6,7], 7))  # [[2,2,3],[7]]
print(combinationSum([2,3,5], 8))  # [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
print(combinationSum([2], 1))  # []
