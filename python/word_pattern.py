# Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

# Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

# Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
# Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
# No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"

# Output: true

# Explanation:

# The bijection can be established as:

# 'a' maps to "dog".
# 'b' maps to "cat".

# Example 2:

# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

# Output: false

# Example 3:

# Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"

# Output: false

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
# pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= s.length <= 3000
# s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
# s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
# All the words in s are separated by a single space.

def word_pattern(pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
    words = s.split(' ')
    if len(pattern) != len(words):
        return False
    
    char_to_word = {}
    word_to_char = {}
    
    for char, word in zip(pattern, words):
        if char in char_to_word and char_to_word[char] != word:
            return False
        if word in word_to_char and word_to_char[word] != char:
            return False
        char_to_word[char] = word
        word_to_char[word] = char
    
    return True

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

# Example Usage:
print(word_pattern("abba", "dog cat cat dog"))  # True
print(word_pattern("abba", "dog cat cat fish"))  # False
print(word_pattern("aaaa", "dog cat cat dog"))  # False
