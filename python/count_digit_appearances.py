# You are given an integer array nums and an integer digit.

# Return the total number of times digit appears in the decimal representation of all elements in nums.

 
# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [12,54,32,22], digit = 2

# Output: 4

# Explanation:

# The digit 2 appears once in 12 and 32, and twice in 22. Thus, the total number of times digit 2 appears is 4.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,34,7], digit = 9

# Output: 0

# Explanation:

# The digit 9 does not appear in the decimal representation of any element in nums, so the total number of times digit 9 appears is 0.

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6​​​​​​​
# 0 <= digit <= 9

def count_digit_appearances(nums, digit):
    # Convert the digit to string for comparison
    digit_str = str(digit)
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for num in nums:
        # Convert the number to string and count occurrences of the digit
        count += str(num).count(digit_str)
    
    return count

# Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the length of nums and m is the average number of digits in the numbers
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Example Usage:
print(count_digit_appearances([12, 54, 32, 22], 2))  # 4
print(count_digit_appearances([1, 34, 7], 9)) # 0
