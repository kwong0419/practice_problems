# You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

# You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

# Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
# Output: [2,3]

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,1]
# Output: [1,2]


# Constraints:

# 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

def findErrorNums(nums):
    seen = set()
    duplicate = None
    missing = None
    
    # Find the duplicate by tracking which number we've seen before
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            duplicate = num
        seen.add(num)
    
    # Find the missing number
    for i in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
        if i not in seen:
            missing = i
    
    return [duplicate, missing]

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

# Example Usage:
print(findErrorNums([1, 2, 2, 4])) # [2,3]
print(findErrorNums([1, 1])) # [1,2]
